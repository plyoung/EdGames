# EdGames

Games in the Unity Editor. Go `Window > Games` to open a game window.

Simply add the `EdGames` folder to a project and you are good to go. There are only editor-side scripts, no textures or such to mess up your project if you happen to import this into an existing project.

### Why?

Cause I can :p

It is a fun way to try out some game mechanics while also sharpening up my editor coding skills.
